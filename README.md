# Tilesheet Maker  

A simple script that takes a grid-based image as a parameter and creates a tile sheet, getting rid of all duplicated tiles.

## Why I made this?

When creating tile-based games, many people work directly with tiles editors, like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). I often tend to work directly in Photoshop, copying and pasting tiles when they already exist, and creating new ones on the fly when needed.  
I usually end up with a giant messy image file, with a lot of duplicate tiles. What I used to do then was to painstakingly pick tiles one by one, and manually add them to a new sprite sheet.

This is a fairly time-consuming process, and I was wondering if there would be some ways to automate it. There are quite a bit of options to manipulate sprites and textures out there, like [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker), but they all seemed overkill since what I thought that what I needed was fairly simple.  

As often, I ended up coding the thing myself. This is certainly not the cleanest code, and it could definitely be optimized, but it does just what I need! You are welcome to use it if you have a similar workflow and you think it could be helpful.    


## How to use    

If you don't have it already, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  

Clone, using `git clone https://github.com/remka/tilesheet.git` or download the repository.  

Open the Terminal, `cd` to the repo folder, and install the dependencies with `npm install` (on a Mac, you can just type `cd`, drop the folder in the Terminal and hit the Return key).  

Use the script by typing `node tile <path-to-image>`. It should work with both absolute and relative paths.  
You can test the script with `node tile image.png` and `node tile level.png`.  

A prompt will ask you the size of your tiles. Type the size in pixels (just type the number), or leave it blank to use the default value (16px). The script won't run if the dimensions of the image you provide is not divisible by the tile size.  

The script will create a `<filename>-tile.png` in the `sprites` folder, removing all duplicated tiles from the original image. The script also creates an optimized (ie. lighter) version of the same file in the `sprites/optimized` folder (this is the version I recommend using if size is an issue).   

## Limitations  

Tested only with PNGs, on a Mac, with version v8.9.2 of Node.  

## TODO

- [x] Export tile sheet as a square-ish shape for easier use in map editor     
- [ ] Allow user to chose between square-ish and strip shapes for export  
- [ ] Support non-square tiles
